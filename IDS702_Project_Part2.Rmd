# IDS702 Final Project Plan Part 2

## Overview
- The data used in this project comes from Kaggle with 607 observation with 11 variables. This dataset does not null or missing value. This is the link to original post: [\textcolor{blue}{Data Science Job Salaries}](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries)
- The Research Questions that we come up with are:
1) Which factors are associated with an increase in salary for data science jobs? (Continuous outcome)
2) How do company size, company location, employment type, employee residence and job title affected the remote work ratio of a data scientist? (Discrete outcome) For this question, there are three possible values for the remote work ratio, 0, 50, and 100; these signify an in-person job, a hybrid job, and a fully remote job, respectively. 

## Models
We will perform different models on the two research questions that we have separately:
1. For the first question, to examine the changes in Salary (USD), a continuous variable as our outcome/response variable, we are considering to use Linear Regression Models, more specifically, Multiple Linear Regression Models. We will fit and assess various models considering experience level, employment type, employee residence, remote ratio, company location and company size as variables. To find the best model in predicting Salary (USD), we will do the selections method mentioned in variable selection.
2. For the second question, the response variable is a categorical variable with 3 levels. Thus the model choice from first question is not applicable here. We can use logistic regression in this case.

## Variable selection
1) Forward, backward,stepwise selection; AIC,BIC, Adjusted-R-Squared
2) Chi-squared test and change in deviance

## Challenges
